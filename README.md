Comprehensive Guide to Ultra-Secure Offline Cryptocurrency Storage

Objective:
This tutorial aims to provide a step-by-step guide on how to safely store your cryptocurrency offline using two USB sticks and a computer, ensuring the highest level of security. This method is designed for those who prioritize long-term safety.

Materials Needed:

2 USB sticks
A computer (without internet connection)
Printer
3 envelopes
Ink pen
Steps:

1. Download BIP39 Repository:

Download the BIP39 repository from https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ onto your computer.
Save the downloaded files on USB stick 1 (USB1).

# 2. Install Linux Fedora on USB2:

Create a bootable Linux Fedora USB on USB stick 2 (USB2).
Ensure that the USB2 stick is formatted and ready for the Linux installation.
# 3. Disconnect from the Internet:

Completely shut down the router or disconnect the internet source.
# 4. Reboot into Linux Fedora Live:

Insert USB2 into the computer.
Reboot the computer and access the boot menu to boot into Linux Fedora Live from USB2.
# 5. Generate 24 Words Using BIP39:

Open the BIP39 repository from USB1.
Click "Generate 24 Words" and save them securely.
# 6. Copy Wallet INCOMING Addresses:

Copy your wallet INCOMING addresses using BIP84 for Bitcoin and BIP44 for other coins.
Save these addresses in an "incoming.txt" file on USB1.
# 7. Create PGP Key Pair Using Kleopatra:

Use Kleopatra to create a new keypair with 4096-bit strong PGP keys.
Use an extremely complex passphrase and write it down by hand with ink.
# 8. Encrypt 24-Words and Export PGP Private Key:

Encrypt the 24-words in Kleopatra and save the file as "mnemonics.txt" onto the desktop.
Export the PGP private key onto the desktop as well.
# 9. Print Multiple Copies:

Connect the computer to the printer.
Print three copies of both "mnemonics.txt" and the PGP private key.
After printing, immediately unplug the printer from electricity.
# 10. Restart Normally:

Restart the computer normally, ensuring no connection to the internet.
# 11. Verify Account Balances:

Open "incoming.txt" and check the balances of the accounts. Ensure they all show 0.
Send small values into the accounts you intend to use.
Check the balances; if funded, everything is in order.
# 12. Secure Copies in Envelopes:

Use three envelopes to store each printed copy of the PGP private key along with the encrypted "mnemonics.txt."
Seal and sign each envelope.
Store these copies in different locations (e.g., home, office, parents' house, friends' house, or send them far away).
# 13. Vault Storage for Passphrase:

Store the passphrase for your PGP key in your bank vault or two separate bank vaults for added security.

This method ensures that your cryptocurrency is stored securely offline with redundant copies in various locations, providing a robust solution for long-term storage.
